# Personal-Website-Presentation
Website about me, services and other stuff alike It is built using ASP.NET Core, Razor pages and C# code behind. It was also extended in the "NETLess" branch using only Front End markups and code, React and other (and back end of course).
The website is NOT deployed and published yet due to several reasons, memory shortage, economic and payment issues, it is welcomed to advice have a way to help me out financially or with other services.
